# Homework 2: Audio Processing Effect Proposal

This document describes the audio effect proposed for implementation later in the course.


## Proposed Effect

The proposed audio effect will require two phases: recording and playback.

During the recording phase, the system will monitor and store audio from its input channel.
The dynamics of user interaction with this process are to be determined at a later time, but the user will (in some way) initiate the recording phase.

Once a recording has been acquired, the system may enter the playback phase.
During this period, it will produce output which is generated by convolving the input channel with the recorded sample.
The played-back output is adjusted by returning to the recording phase and capturing a new sample with which to convolve the input channel.

Thus, for example:
- Recording a single, sharp sound will result in minimal modification during the playback phase,
- Recording two sharp sounds will add a single echo to the played-back output,
- Recording a longer sound may create a flanger- or chorus-like effect.


## Collaboration

This project will be conducted alone, without the assistance of a teammate.
